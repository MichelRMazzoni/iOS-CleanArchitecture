This is a sample app about how to implement a Clean architecture for an iOS application using MVVM, <a href="https://github.com/Moya/Moya">Moya</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift">RxSwift</a>.

If you're looking for an example without using RxSwift then you should switch to branch <a href="https://github.com/arturdev/iOS-CleanArchitecture/tree/withoutRX">withoutRX</a>
